# Sensors Onboarding
Welcome to the sensors subteam! We work on integrating, configuring, and fusing all the different sensors of the robot together so that it can localize itself and understand its surroundings. You can think of sensors as the backbone or glue of the teamâ€”we help connect subsystems together and provide the crucial information necessary for them to function. In this onboarding project, you will get your local environment setup so you can work with our software stack, then you will get to work with real sensors on a project that may find its way onto our actual robot!

## Setup
Please follow the [environment setup instructions](https://github.com/umigv/environment) to get your local environment up and running, then clone this repository into the `ws/src` folder as follows:
```sh
cd [your environment folder]/ws/src
git clone --recursive https://github.com/umigv/sensors-onboarding.git
```

## Learning ROS
If you don't already know ROS or haven't used ROS2 yet, go through the beginner ROS tutorials linked [here](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html). You don't have to work through all of these, especially not step-by-step, but a once-over of the materials will help you understand a lot of the concepts that we will be working with in ROS like nodes, topics, publishers and subscribers, and more. The beginner tutorials (CLI Tools and Client Libraries) should be all you need to get started. You can skip **Beginner: CLI Tools/Configuring environment** since that has already been done for you in the Docker container. The ROS tutorial packages for **Beginner: Client Libraries** have already been cloned for you in this repository under `ros_tutorials`, so you don't need to clone them yourself. When you get to the Client Libraries section, you only need to familiarize yourself with the **C++/Python (will decide later)** documentation, since that is the language we have used for our packages. However, if you prefer the other language, feel free to learn how to use it as well and write your packages in the langauge you want.

## Hands-On Project
TBD

### Ideas:
- Add new feature to IMU driver
    - Could take some feature out like accounting for gravity and ask new members to add in
- Integrate encoders with IMU for localization
- Build towards teamwide goal like Jason mentioned

## Timeline
- Week 1: Introductions, environment setup, start on ROS tutorials if time
- Week 2: Finish ROS tutorials, introduce main onboarding project (TBD, ideas above)
- Week 3: Wrap up onboarding project and introduce robot goals and projects
